; commands to test:
dome color grey
;does this overide all current images?


#This is just kind of an outline. I figure someone
#can add durations to the transitions and dome colors 
#and other stuff needed to complete these scenes.
#Not all the scenes have text because the creative team
#hasn't finished all of it. Anyway! Let me know if you
#have any questions on slack about what I've done.

desc text "We are now in the mantle, the |gooey slow-moving lava underneath the surface |of the Earth. The mantle is made up of 44.8% |oxygen, 21.5% silicon, and 22.8% magnesium. |There's also iron, aluminum, calcium, sodium, |and potassium. It is about 1,800 miles thick |and makes up nearly 80% of the Earth's total volume."

#THIS IS FOR THE CRUST SCENE
desc text "Here we see the Earth's crust. The crust |is only about 3-5 miles thick |under the oceans and about 25 miles thick |under the continents. On top of the crust |we find life such as humans who congregate |in areas such as Ephraim, which you see here."

#THIS IS FOR THE EARTH LAYERS CUT IN HALF SCENE
desc text "Earth has a solid iron inner core with |a liquid outer core made up of nickel-alloy. |The mantle is a very hot plastic like layer |that makes up a vast majority of the total|mass of the Earth. The crust is the smallest |layer and is the part of the Earth that we live on."

#THIS IS FOR THE APOLLO 11 LANDING SITE SCENE
desc text "The Apollo 11 landing site is the site |where Niel Armstrong took his first steps |on the Moon. The astronauts of the Apollo |missions brought back significant amounts |of lunar rock and showed us how to continue |to explore space. This historic event ended |the space race between the United States and |the Soviet Union."

#THIS IS FOR THE MARS SCENE
desc text "Mars is one of the most observed bodies in |the solar system. It is the 4th planet in the |solar system and roughly half the size of |Earth. Over the course of 40 years, many missions |have been sent to Mars from rovers to fly-by |missions. This extensive research on the surface |has shown that Mars had liquid water flowing on |its surface in the past. Signs of rivers and |oceans are prevalent on Mars. With water being |present in Marsâ€™ past, it is possible that some |form of life could have existed on Mars as well."

#THIS IS FOR THE NEPTUNE SCENE
desc text "Gaseous planets, such as Neptune, typically |have rings and do not have a surface. If we |were to send an astronaut to one of the Jovian |planets they would sink to the center and be |crushed by the pressure, never being able to |land on a solid crust."
