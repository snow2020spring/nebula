Step 1: Core
* Black screen.

Step 2: Mantle
* Red screen.
* Message about where we are written by Emily.
We are now in the mantle, the gooey slow-moving lava underneath the surface of the Earth. The mantle is made up of 44.8% oxygen, 21.5% silicon, and 22.8% magnesium. There's also iron, aluminum, calcium, sodium, and potassium. It is about 1,800 miles thick and makes up nearly 80% of the Earth's total volume.
Step 3: Crust
* Show Ephraim.
* Message written by Emily.
Here we see the Earth's crust. The crust is only about 3-5 miles thick under the oceans and about 25 miles thick under the continents. On top of the crust we find life such as humans who congregate in areas such as Ephraim, which you see here.
Step 4: Earth Layers (Cut in half)
* Dot with a line to show our journey so far labeled with the name of the mission.
* Written by Tyler.
        Earth has a solid iron inner core with a liquid outer core made up of nickel-alloy. The mantle is a very hot plastic like layer that makes up a vast majority of the total mass of the Earth. The crust is the smallest layer and is the part of the Earth that we live on.
Step 5: Moon
* Show the Apollo 11 Landing Site.
* Written by Tyler.
The Apollo 11 landing site is the site where Niel Armstrong took his first steps on the Moon. The astronauts of the Apollo missions brought back significant amounts of lunar rock and showed us how to continue to explore space. This historic event ended the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Step 6: Mars
* Information about missions, water, and possible life.
* Written by Tyler.
        Mars is one of the most observed bodies in the solar system. It is the 4th planet in the solar system and roughly half the size of Earth. Over the course of 40 years, many missions have been sent to Mars from rovers to fly-by missions. This extensive research on the surface has shown that Mars had liquid water flowing on its surface in the past. Signs of rivers and oceans are prevalent on Mars. With water being present in Mars’ past, it is possible that some form of life could have existed on Mars as well. 
Step 7: Neptune
* Information about how Neptune is gaseous, has rings, and how the jovian planets do not have solid surfaces.
* Written by Emily.
Gaseous planets, such as Neptune, typically have rings and do not have a surface. If we were to send an astronaut to one of the Jovian planets they would sink to the center and be crushed by the pressure, never being able to land on a solid crust.
Step 8: Kepler Belt
* Information about the belt including that Pluto orbits inside the belt.
* Written by Iyonna.
Step 9: Pluto
* Information about dwarf planets.
* Show actual pictures from the Horizon mission.
* Written by Iyonna.
Step 10: Oort Cloud
* Information including how this is the end of the range of gravity our Sun has.
* Written by Tyler.
        The Oort Cloud is the edge of the solar system. Scientists dont know much, but are confident that it is a roughly spherical region of comets whose center is the sun. it marks the external boundaries of the Solar System. 
Step 11: Possible Planet X
* Gag/joke with badgers.
* Written by all.
